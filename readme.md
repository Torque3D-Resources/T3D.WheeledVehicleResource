<h1>Wheeled Vehicle Resource</h1>
<p>A collection of upgrades for Wheeled Vehicle behavior ported from TGE to Torque 3D.</p>
<p>This combines and extends several classic engine resources to provide several core improvements. A simulated drive train allows vehicles to be created with a wide range of performence characteristics. A number of GUI elements have been added or improved and script handling for multiple mounts is more fleshed out.</p>
